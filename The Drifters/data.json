The height can vary from 20-30cm to 3m, has pinnate leaves, flowers with the pipalilla corolla, is easy to grow and available. Sweet Pea is a very popular and familiar hardy annual flowering plant. It is appreciated for it's delicate blooms and fragrant scents. When trained up a wall or trellis it can reach a height of three metres. Without support it can be grown in a mixed annual border - particularly dwarf varieties. With regular deadheading the flush of flowers, that begins in early summer, will continue right into the autumn. Lathyrus flowers come in a very wide array of colours including white, pinks, reds, mauves, blues,and purples. Most sweet pea blooms are pleasantly scented.",

              "illnesses": "The sweet pea plant does suffer from some pests, the most common being aphids. These insects suck the sap out of the plants, reducing growth. A pest called the pollen beetle which is small, shiny and black, eats the pollen and disfigures the flowers. Another problem is mildew; this is a white powdery coating that covers the leaves and slows down growth.The sweet pea is also susceptible to ethylene in quantities produced by senescing plants. Because of this, growers are encouraged to plant sweet peas away from fruit trees among other plants prone to early dieback or senescence.",

Cuttings are often nebulized and kept at a temperature of around 20Â°C. After about a month they will have developed a very thin and fragile root system, for which they will be gently potted in 8 cm diameter pots containing a peat substrate, pine needles and heath land.",
              "illnesses": "The diseases that most often affect azaleas in the apartment are mainly physiopaths. If the leaves and flowers turn out to be faded and withered they denote a lack of water, so it is necessary to completely immerse the vase in water until no more air bubbles are formed and then it is allowed to drain.",

The island mallow (L. assurgentiflora, also called Malva assurgentiflora), is native to California, where the plant is easily naturalized in coastal gardens. Other species of Lavatera such as L. maritima, L. trimestris and L. thuringiaca grow best in a Mediterranean-type or coastal climate that features mild winters and long, hot summers. Lavatera is a short-lived plant and is considered pest- and disease-free because it rarely suffers from insect or disease damage. That does not mean the plant never has problems, but it can usually resist them.",
