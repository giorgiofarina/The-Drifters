The height can vary from 20-30cm to 3m, has pinnate leaves, flowers with the pipalilla corolla, is easy to grow and available. Sweet Pea is a very popular and familiar hardy annual flowering plant. It is appreciated for it's delicate blooms and fragrant scents. When trained up a wall or trellis it can reach a height of three metres. Without support it can be grown in a mixed annual border - particularly dwarf varieties. With regular deadheading the flush of flowers, that begins in early summer, will continue right into the autumn. Lathyrus flowers come in a very wide array of colours including white, pinks, reds, mauves, blues,and purples. Most sweet pea blooms are pleasantly scented.",
